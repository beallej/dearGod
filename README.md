# Dear God
## Created by Laura Biester, Thomas Redding, Josie Bealle and Wanchen Yao at HackISU 2015

Do you have a lot of problems in your life? Do you have trouble trusting those around you for advice?

When you ask for advice, you'll be paired with a random individual, who will act as "God". Their instructions may provide insight that other's can not. Plus, look at other questions to God to hear what everyone else is thinking about.
